# question: what is the difference between package.json and package-lock.json?

answer:

- package.json:

  - this file contains metadata about your project, including dependencies, scripts, and configurations.
  - it defines which packages your project depends on and can specify version ranges.

- package-lock.json:
  - this file records the exact version of each package and its dependencies installed in your project.
  - it ensures that the same dependency tree is recreated when someone else installs the project, providing consistent behavior across different environments.
