# question: what is the useEffect hook? how can we achieve functionality of life cycle methods in functional components.

answer: - the useEffect hook is a built-in hook in react that allows you to perform side effects in functional components. - side effects can include data fetching, subscriptions, or manually changing the dom. - the useEffect hook replaces the lifecycle methods of class components (like componentDidMount, componentDidUpdate, and componentWillUnmount) in functional components.

- syntax of useEffect

```code
    useEffect(() => {
      // code to perform the side effect
      return () => {
        // optional cleanup code
      };
      }, [dependencies]);
```

- first argument:
- a function containing the side effect code you want to execute.
- second argument:
  - an optional array of dependencies. the effect runs when the component mounts and whenever any of the dependencies change.
  - if the array is empty ([]), the effect runs only once when the component mounts.

performing life cycle methods with useEffect

1. simulating componentDidMount

   - the effect runs once when the component mounts.
   - you can achieve this by passing an empty array as the second argument.

```code
    import {useEffect} from "react";

    const ComponentDidMountExample = () => {

    useEffect(() => {
      console.log("Component mounted");
      }, []);    //runs only once
      return <div>component mounted</div>;
      };
```

2. simulating componentDidUpdate

   - to run an effect when specific state or prop values change, you include those values in the dependency array.
   - the effect runs after every render where the specified dependencies change.

```code
    import {useState, useEffect} from "react";

    const ComponentDidUpdateExample = () => {
      const [count, setCount] = useState(0);
      useEffect(() => {
        console.log(`component updated, count: ${count}`);
       }, [count]);   // runs whenever `count` changes

      return (
        <div> <p>count: {count}</p>
          <button onClick={() => setCount(count + 1)}>increment</button>
        </div> );
      };
```

3. simulating componentWillUnmount

   - to perform cleanup (like unsubscribing from events or cancelling api requests), you can return a cleanup function from your effect.
   - this function runs when the component unmounts.

```code
import {useEffect} from "react";

const ComponentWillUnmountExample = () => {
  useEffect(() => {
    console.log("component mounted");
  }
  return () => {
    console.log("component unmounted");
    }; }, []);  // empty array ensures this runs on unmount

    return <div>component will unmount</div>;
   };
```

summary

- useEffect is a powerful tool in functional components for managing side effects.
- you can simulate lifecycle methods:
  - use an empty array for componentDidMount.
  - include dependencies for componentDidUpdate.
  - return a cleanup function for componentWillUnmount.
- by using useEffect, you can write cleaner, more maintainable code in functional components while leveraging the power of react's life cycle management.

### when & why to useEffect?

- when you need to perform side effects in a functional component
- why useEffect lets you run code (data fetching, subscriptions, manual dom updates) after react has updated the ui, matching the timing of class life cycles without blocking render

- when you want to run code once on mount
- why passing an empty dependency array ([]) ensures your effect runs only after the first render, ideal for initializing data or setting up subscriptions

- when you need to react to changes in specific props or state
- why listing dependencies in the array ([foo, bar]) makes react re-run the effect only when those values change, keeping your logic tied precisely to relevant updates

- when you must clean up resources on unmount or before re-running an effect
- why returning a cleanup function from useEffect ensures timers, subscriptions, or event listeners are torn down correctly, preventing memory leaks or stale data

- when integrating with browser apis or third-party libraries
- why useEffect provides a clear place to imperatively call fetch(), initialize maps, set up analytics, or attach listeners, while ensuring teardown happens automatically

- when you want to orchestrate asynchronous flows in response to state changes
- why by combining async logic inside useEffect (or inside an async function called from it), you can sequence fetching, polling, or chained updates in a declarative, dependency-driven way
