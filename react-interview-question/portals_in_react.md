# question: what are portals in react?

answer:

- portals in react provide a way to render children into a different part of the dom that exists outside the parent component’s hierarchy, while still preserving the react structure and behavior.
- this is useful when you need to render components like modals, tooltips, or popups that should visually appear outside the main application flow.
- normally, react renders a component inside its parent’s dom structure, but with portals, you can instruct react to render a component somewhere else in the dom, like in a sibling element outside the main div.

how to use react portals you can create a portal using the ReactDOM.createPortal method:

```code
ReactDOM.createPortal(child, container);
```

- child: the react component you want to render.
- container: the dom element where you want to render the component
- example: using portals for a modal

```code
import React from "react";
import ReactDOM from "react-dom";

function Modal({ children, onClose}) {
  return ReactDOM.createPortal( <div>
  <div> {children} <button onClick={onClose}>close modal</button>
  </div>
 </div>,

 document.getElementById("modal-root")// modal will render here
 );
}
function App() {
  const [isOpen, setIsOpen] = React.useState(false);
  return (
    <div>
      <h1>hello, app component!</h1>
      <button onClick={() => setIsOpen(true)}>open modal</button>
      {isOpen && ( <Modal onClose={() => setIsOpen(false)}>
        <p>this is a modal rendered using a portal!</p>
        </Modal> )}
      </div> );
      }
    export default App;
```

steps:

1. portal target:

   - in your html file, create a separate div for the modal. this is where the modal will be rendered outside the main app:

   ```code
   <div id="root"></div> <div id="modal-root"></div><!-- modal will render here -->
   ```

2. ReactDOM.createPortal:

   - the modal component uses createPortal to render the modal into the modal-root div, which is outside the parent component (app).

3. event handling:

   - despite being rendered outside the parent’s dom structure, the modal still behaves like it’s part of the same react tree.
   - event bubbling and state management work as expected.
   - why use portals?
     - modals: you can render modals that need to appear on top of everything else but be outside the main dom flow.
     - tooltips and popups: they often need to be rendered outside regular content to avoid css overflow issues.
     - handling overflow issues: portals allow you to render components in a way that avoids problems with parent components that may have hidden overflow.

conclusion: - react portals are used to render components outside their parent dom hierarchy while maintaining logical connections in react’s structure. - this is ideal for rendering ui elements like modals and tooltips, ensuring they behave as part of the react app even when placed in a different part of the dom.

### when & why to use portals?

- when you need to render ui elements (modals, tooltips, popovers, notifications) that must visually break out of their parent’s layout or overflow constraints
- why portals let you mount those elements into a separate dom node so they aren’t clipped or hidden, yet still participate in react’s event system and context

- when you want to preserve react context and event bubbling for components that live outside the main app container
- why even though the portal’s output is attached elsewhere in the dom, it maintains the original react tree, so context providers, state, and event handlers work seamlessly

- when implementing global or top-level layers (like toasts or dialogs) that should sit above all other content
- why mounting these layers via a portal simplifies styling and z-index management, letting you keep your main app markup uncluttered

- when integrating with third-party libraries or css frameworks that expect certain container elements
- why you can direct react to render into those existing containers without restructuring your component hierarchy or losing react’s declarative model
