# question: what is virtual dom?

answer:

- the virtual dom is a lightweight representation of the actual dom.
- react maintains this in-memory version to optimize performance.
- when a component's state changes, react creates a new Virtual DOM and compares it with the previous one using a process called "reconciliation."
- this allows react to identify what has changed and update only those specific parts of the actual dom, making updates efficient and minimizing reflows and repaints in the browser.

- example:

  ```code
    import {useState} from "react";

    function Counter() {
      const [count, setCount] = useState(0);

       return (
         <div>
           <p>you clicked {count} times</p>
          <button onClick={() => setCount(count + 1)}>click me</button>
        </div>
        );
       }

  ```

- in this example, when the button is clicked, react only updates the text displaying the count, thanks to the virtual dom.

### when & why to use the virtual dom?

- when your ui updates frequently

  - when you have animations, live data feeds, form validations, or any component that updates on every keystroke or timer.
  - why the virtual dom diffs and batch-writes changes, preventing costly direct dom manipulations on every render.

- when dealing with large or deeply-nested trees

  - when your page contains complex hierarchies (e.g. dashboards with dozens of widgets).
  - why react’s diff algorithm can quickly find and update only the nodes that changed, rather than re-rendering the entire tree.

- when you want predictable performance

  - when you need smooth interactions (e.g. dragging, scrolling) under heavy update loads.
  - why the virtual dom abstracts away manual optimizations—React internally decides the most efficient way to reconcile changes.

- when you’re writing declarative code
  - when you describe what the ui should look like for a given state, not how to mutate the dom step by step.
  - why react handles the “how” via the virtual dom, so you can focus on “what” the ui should be, making your code more readable and maintainable
