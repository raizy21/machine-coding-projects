# question: how do you optimize a react app?

answer:

- to optimize a React app, consider the following strategies:

  1. code splitting:

  - use React.lazy and Suspense for lazy loading components.

  2. memorization:

  - use React.memo, useMemo, and useCallback to prevent unnecessary rerenders.

  3. virtualization:

  - render only visible elements in long lists using libraries like react-window.

  4. avoid inline functions:

  - define functions outside of the render method.

  5. use pure components:

  - use React.PureComponent or React.memo to avoid re-renders.

### when & why to optimize a react app?

##### when to optimize a react app

- during development of large or growing codebases
- when you notice increasing bundle sizes, slowed build times, or code duplication that could hamper maintainability.

- before shipping to production
- as you prepare for real-world usage, especially on slow networks or low-powered devices.

- after identifying performance bottlenecks
- if your app feels janky (stutters during scrolling, typing, or animations) or metrics (lighthouse, profiler) flag slow renders.

- when adding new features that impact render paths
- any time you introduce complex uis (charts, virtualized lists, maps), data-heavy components, or frequent updates.

##### why to optimize a react app

- improve user experience
- snappy interactions and quick load times reduce frustration and increase engagement.

- reduce initial bundle size
- smaller downloads mean faster first-paint and time-to-interactive on slow connections.

- minimize cpu and memory usage
- lower resource consumption helps on mobile devices and prolongs battery life.

- enable scalability
- optimized components and code-splitting let your app grow without exponentially increasing render costs.

- boost seo and accessibility
- faster page loads improve search rankings and make content available sooner to assistive technologies.

- lower operational costs
- efficient code can reduce server-side rendering and bandwidth expenses if youâ€™re hosting high-traffic apps.
