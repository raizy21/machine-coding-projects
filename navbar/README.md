# navbar

this code demonstrates how to create a responsive navigation bar (navbar) with a hamburger menu using react router and react hooks.

key features:

1. navigation menu:

   - the navbar component includes a logo and four navigation links: home, about, services, and contact.
   - these links are wrapped with the nav link component from react-router-dom, which allows for smooth page navigation without reloading the entire page.

2. responsive hamburger menu:

   - the useState hook (isMenuOpen) is used to manage whether the mobile-friendly hamburger menu is open or closed.
   - when the hamburger icon is clicked, the toggleMenu function changes the state, showing or hiding the links in mobile view.
   - if the state isMenuOpen is true, a css class active is added to display the links; otherwise, they remain hidden.

3. page navigation:

   - the router and routes components handle page routing.
   - each route specifies which component should be displayed for the corresponding path:
     - /: home component
     - /about: about component
     - /services: services component
     - /contact: Contact component

4. css classes:
   - the styling of the navbar and its responsiveness (e.g., hiding/showing links based on screen size) is controlled via css classes (navbar, menu, menu-icon, navbar-links, etc.).
   - example workflow: when a user clicks on the hamburger menu (three lines), the navigation links (home, about, services, contact) are displayed or hidden.
   - clicking on any link closes the menu and navigates to the respective page.
   - this setup makes it easy to implement client-side routing for single-page applications (spas) with a responsive,
     user-friendly design.
