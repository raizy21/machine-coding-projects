# image carousel

this code creates an image carousel using react, which automatically cycles through a set of images fetched from the reddit api.

the key parts:

- state management:

  - images: stores an array of image urls fetched from the api.
  - index: keeps track of the currently displayed image in the carousel.
  - api call: The ApiCall function fetches the top posts from the "aww" subreddit and extracts only the .jpg image urls.
  - the useEffect hook ensures that this api call happens when the component first renders.

- carousel functionality:
  - an interval is set to automatically change the image every 3 seconds.
  - handleNext and handlePrev functions allow manual navigation through the images using next/previous buttons.
  - the image changes in a loop, i.e., when it reaches the last image, it starts over from the first one.
- rendering:

  - if there are images available, the carousel with navigation buttons is displayed.
  - if images are still being fetched, a "loading images..." message is shown.

  this component continuously shows new images, either automatically or when the user clicks the buttons, and handles the image data fetched from the reddit api.
