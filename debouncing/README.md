# debouncing

debouncing is a technique used to limit the rate at which a function is executed. it ensures that a function only runs after a specified period of time has passed since the last event, such as typing or clicking.

key points:

- purpose:
  - to prevent a function from being called too frequently, improving performance.

how it works:

- if an event (like typing) is triggered multiple times in quick succession, debouncing waits until a specified time (e.g., 500 milliseconds) has passed without additional events before executing the function.

- common uses: search bars, form validation, and handling window resize or scroll events.

this example demonstrates how debouncing works in a react component. debouncing is a technique used to limit how often a function is executed, particularly useful for improving performance when handling user input.

1.  state variables:

- searchTerm: tracks the value entered in the search input.
- results: stores the data returned from the api based on the search term.
- loading: indicates whether the data is being fetched.
- error: stores any error message if the api request fails.

2.  debouncing logic:

- as the user types, the searchTerm is updated immediately, but the api call is delayed by 1 second after the last keypress.
- this prevents multiple requests from being sent rapidly, which would happen if we called the api on every keystroke.
- the useEffect hook monitors changes in the searchTerm.
- when a change occurs, it sets a 1-second delay using setTimeout.
- if the user types again before 1 second, the previous timeout is cleared, and a new one is started.

3. fetching data:

- once the user stops typing for 1 second, the api request is triggered using the fetchResults function.
- the results are displayed below the search bar, showing wikipedia article titles and snippets based on the search term.

4. error handling:

   - if the api request fails for any reason, an error message is displayed to the user.

   how it works:

   - input handling:
     - the onChange event in the input field updates the searchTerm state.
     - the api call only happens after the user stops typing for 1 second.
     - api call: once the input stabilizes (i.e., the user stops typing), the useEffect function makes a call to the wikipedia api and updates the results state with the search results.

by implementing debouncing, we avoid unnecessary api calls when users are typing quickly.
this results in smoother performance and better user experience.
