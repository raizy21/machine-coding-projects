# modal

this react example demonstrates how to create a simple modal popup where users can accept an offer.

1. main component (App):

   - showModal controls whether the modal is visible.
   - offerAccepted displays a message when the offer is accepted.
   - clicking "show modal" opens the modal, and clicking outside the modal or on the close button (x) hides it.

2. Modal component:

   - displays a message with two buttons:
   - one to close the modal.
   - one to accept the offer, which closes the modal and shows a confirmation message.

the modal is easily reusable by changing its content or actions.
