# my context

this example demonstrates how to use the react context api to pass data (in this case, a string) from a parent component (app) to a child component (child) without having to pass the data explicitly via props.

components involved:

1. MyContext:

   - created using createContext().
     - it will store and provide the value that can be accessed in any child component using useContext.

2. App:

   - the app component sets up the context provider (MyContext.Provider) with a value (name = "john") that will be passed down to the child component.
   - the context provider wraps the child component, making the value available to it.

3. child: the child component accesses the name value from MyContext using the useContext(MyContext) hook.

   - this value (name) is displayed inside an <h1> tag.

   key concepts:

   - context:
     - a way to share data across multiple components without passing it explicitly through props.
   - useContext:
     - a hook that allows components to access the value provided by the context.
   - context provider:
     - wraps components and provides a value that can be accessed by any component within the providerâ€™s scope.

this example shows how to use useContext to simplify data access in react, making it easier to share state or data across components without "prop drilling."
