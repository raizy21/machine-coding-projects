# cascading dropdowns

cascading dropdowns (also known as dependent or linked dropdowns) are a set of dropdown menus where the options in one dropdown depend on the selection made in another. essentially, the value chosen in the first dropdown determines the available options in the second dropdown, and so on if there are more.

how cascading dropdowns work:

1. first dropdown:

   - contains a list of primary options (e.g., countries).

2. second cropdown:

   - displays options based on the selection in the first dropdown (e.g., states or regions within the selected country).

3. third dropdown (optional):

   - can be further dependent on the second dropdown's selection (e.g., cities in the selected state or region).

this example demonstrates how to create cascading dropdowns where the options available in one dropdown depend on the selection made in the previous dropdown. the three dropdowns in this case are for country, state, and city.

how it works:

- country dropdown:

  - the list of countries is loaded when the component mounts.
  - when a user selects a country, the state dropdown is filtered to show states that belong to the selected country.

- state dropdown:
  - after selecting a state, the cities that belong to that state are displayed in the city dropdown.
- city dropdown:
  - finally, the user selects a city from the available options filtered by the selected state.
- key points:
  - the component uses the useState hook to manage the selected country, state, and city. the useEffect hook initializes the country list when the component is first loaded. each dropdown dynamically updates based on the previous selection, ensuring only relevant options are displayed. this cascading dropdown system is commonly used in forms that require hierarchical data selection, such as selecting a location based on country, state, and city.
