# count down

the count down component is a react-based countdown timer that allows the user to input a time in minutes and then start, pause, or reset the timer.

state management: time: tracks the countdown time in seconds.
isActive: determines whether the timer is running.  
 isPause: indicates whether the timer is paused.  
core functions: handleTime:

- this function takes the user input in minutes, converts it to seconds, and sets the time state.  
  timer: a utility function that formats the remaining time into mm:ss format for display.  
  handleStart: starts the countdown by setting isActive to true.  
  handlePause: toggles the pause state of the countdown.  
  handleReset: stops the timer, resets the time to zero, and clears any active intervals.  
  effect hook: the useEffect hook runs the countdown, updating the time every second when the timer is active and not paused.

when the time reaches zero, the timer stops automatically.

- buttons: start: begins the countdown.
- pause: pauses or resumes the timer.
- reset: stops the timer and resets the countdown to zero.

this component demonstrates basic timer logic with the use of react hooks (useState, useEffect, and useRef).
